# RedirectLinkDiscordBot
Bot that's mainly used in team Covenant's discord server for organization (and fun).

Currently contains:
  <li> -Redirect links to appropriate channel so we stop losing important references in the piles of messages and links</li>
  <li> -Clean method that helps to remove spam (Use "!purge [phrase]" to delete messages equalling that phrase. In development) </li>
  <li> -Quote saving for each user. (Use "!quote [phrase]" to save/change a phrase, then "!qs" to use your phrase whenever)
